        This Swedish Meatballs rocks!

    <p>
        This Swedish meatball recipe is our family's Christmas tradition. We frequently double the recipe and keep it warm in a slow cooker. Worth the effort, and the meatballs are even better the next day! Reserve brown gravy and add sour cream to it the day you serve the leftovers.
